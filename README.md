flowcharts
==========

This repo contains flowcharted ZFS code from the current illumos-gate. Informational only; 
flowcharts only valid for the version of code that was current at the time of generation.

I do not plan to maintain those for each Illumos release or gate commit; if changes are significant,
I'll likely have to think of a versioning scheme.

NOTE: They are quite large and may break your Adobe Reader on a slow machine.

Flowcharts generated using Visustin Pro v7.03, http://www.aivosto.com/visustin.html

Just like the code they show, they are under the CDDL license.
